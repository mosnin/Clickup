# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and other AI assistants) working in this repository.

## What this is

A ClickUp-style productivity app: tasks, docs, goals, chat — for individuals and teams. Each account has one **personal space** (private to the user) and zero or more **team workspaces** (shared with members). The current commit is a working scaffold with the marketing site, auth flow, onboarding, and dashboard shell wired up; most domain features (tasks, docs, etc.) are not yet implemented.

## Commands

```bash
npm install              # install JS deps
npx convex dev           # start Convex dev server (also generates convex/_generated)
npm run dev              # start Next.js dev server (separate terminal)

npm run build            # production build (next build) — runs lint + typecheck
npm run lint             # next lint
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit (Next.js tree only; convex/ checked by Convex CLI)
```

You need **two terminals** in dev: one for `npx convex dev`, one for `npm run dev`. Convex's dev server regenerates `convex/_generated/` on every schema/function change.

## Data model (Convex)

```
Workspace (team) ─┐
                  ├─ Space ─ Folder? ─ List ─ Task ─ Subtask
User (personal) ──┘
```

- `users` — mirrored from Clerk via the webhook in `convex/http.ts`, with a fallback `users.ensureCurrent` mutation for environments where webhooks aren't reachable. Indexed by `clerkId`.
- `workspaces` — team workspaces. `ownerClerkId` is the creator.
- `memberships` — many-to-many between users and workspaces. Roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`.
- `spaces` — top-level containers. `parentType: "user" | "workspace"`. A user's personal space is auto-created on first webhook sync (or first `ensureCurrent`) with `parentType: "user"`, `parentId: <clerkId>`.
- `folders` — optional grouping inside a space.
- `lists` — `parentType: "space" | "folder"` discriminated parent.
- `tasks` — belong to a list. `statusId` references a `listStatuses` row in the same list. `parentTaskId` makes a task a subtask of another. `startDate` (optional) and `dueDate` (optional) drive the Gantt and Calendar views.
- `listStatuses` — per-list workflow stages. Every list seeds 4 defaults on creation (To Do / In Progress / Complete / Closed). Each row has a `category` (`open | in_progress | complete | closed`) so the UI can answer "is this complete?" without hardcoding names.
- `customFields` — per-list field definitions. `type` is one of `text | number | dropdown | date | checkbox`. Dropdown rows carry an `options` array.
- `taskFieldValues` — sparse value rows keyed by `(taskId, fieldId)`. The four optional `*Value` columns hold the typed primitive; dropdown stores its option id in `textValue`.
- `messages` — comments and chat in a single table. Polymorphic parent (`parentType: "task" | "space" | "workspace"`, `parentId: string`). `parentMessageId` makes a message a reply. `assigneeClerkId` + `resolvedAt` model "assigned comments". Mention tokens live inline in `body` as `@[Name](clerkId)`.
- `mentions` — one row per mention. `parentType`/`parentId` are denormalized from the message so the inbox query is O(unread) without resolving each message's parent.
- `docs` — rich-text documents. Polymorphic parent (`user | workspace | space`). `content` holds Tiptap/ProseMirror JSON.
- `whiteboards` — tldraw-backed boards with the same parent shape. `snapshot` holds the tldraw store snapshot.
- `timeEntries` — one row per time-tracked interval. `endedAt` undefined means the timer is currently running. Convex doesn't index `undefined` cleanly, so the running-entry lookup walks recent entries by user; the working set per user is tiny (typically 0 or 1).
- `goals` — `targetType` is `number | money | boolean`. All three share the same `targetValue` / `currentValue` columns; boolean goals always target 1 and the UI renders a checkbox.
- `listAutomations` — per-list rules with one `trigger` (`task_created` | `status_changed_to_complete`) and one `action` (assign user / set priority / set status / set due in N days). Evaluated inline in `tasks.create` and `tasks.update` so all patches stay inside one transaction.
- `tasks.recurrence` — optional `daily | weekly | monthly`. When a task transitions into a complete-category status, `tasks.update` spawns a fresh task on the same list with its dates advanced.
- `clips` — screen-recording metadata. `storageId` references Convex file storage (`Id<"_storage">`); the bytes live there, not in the table. Author owns delete.

**Authorization** is centralized in `convex/_authz.ts`. Every read/write resolves up the hierarchy (task → list → folder?/space → workspace?/user) and calls `canAccessSpace` to confirm either personal ownership or workspace membership. Use `requireListAccess`/`requireSpaceAccess`/`requireFolderAccess` rather than re-rolling checks in each function.

- Public mutations: anything end-user invokable (`workspaces.create`, `tasks.update`, etc.).
- Internal mutations: `users.upsertFromClerk`, `users.deleteFromClerk` — only callable from `convex/http.ts`. Never expose them.

## Conventions

- **TypeScript everywhere.** No `any` unless you can explain why in a comment.
- **Server vs. client components.** Default to server. Add `"use client"` only when you need state, effects, browser APIs, or Clerk hooks (`useUser`, etc.).
- **Routing.** Marketing routes live in `(marketing)`, auth routes in `(auth)`, app routes under `/dashboard`. Add new auth-guarded routes either inside `/dashboard` or extend `isProtectedRoute` in `src/middleware.ts`.
- **Styling.** Tailwind utilities only. Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes. Theme tokens live in `globals.css` under `@theme` — extend there, not via inline arbitrary values.
- **Pill aesthetic.** Buttons use `rounded-full`. Header/footer cards use `rounded-3xl` or `rounded-[2rem]`. Keep the rhythm consistent.
- **Responsive.** Mobile-first; use `md:`/`lg:` for desktop. Test at 360px, 768px, and 1280px before merging UI changes. Sidebar uses a drawer pattern below `md`.
- **Apostrophes in JSX.** Escape as `&apos;` — `react/no-unescaped-entities` is enforced by `next lint`.
- **Convex imports.** From the Next.js tree, use `convex/react` and `convex/react-clerk` (runtime). Typed `api`/`Doc`/`Id` come from `convex/_generated/`, imported via the `@convex/*` path alias (e.g. `import { api } from "@convex/_generated/api"`). The `_generated/` files are checked in as hand-rolled stubs so a fresh checkout typechecks; `npx convex dev` and `npx convex deploy` overwrite them with the real generated content.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the canonical list. Two grouping rules:

- Anything starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is bundled into the client; never put secrets there.
- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is consumed by **Convex**, not Next.js — set it via `npx convex env set CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET …`. The Clerk webhook URL points to `https://<deployment>.convex.site/clerk`.

## Initial setup steps

When bringing up a fresh checkout:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx convex dev` — creates a Convex deployment and writes `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` into `.env.local`.
3. Create a Clerk app, copy publishable + secret keys into `.env.local`.
4. In Clerk → JWT Templates, create a "Convex" template; copy the Frontend API URL into `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL`.
5. In Clerk → Webhooks, add an endpoint at `https://<deployment>.convex.site/clerk` subscribed to `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`. Copy the signing secret with `npx convex env set CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET …`.
6. Get a Resend API key and set `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`.
7. `npm run dev` (Convex dev keeps running in another terminal).

## Vercel deployment

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Required env vars: every entry in `.env.example`. `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` only needs to exist on Vercel (not local).
- For preview deployments to share a Convex backend with prod, add `npx convex deploy` to a Vercel build hook or use `npx convex env` to manage per-environment values.

## Things AI assistants should not do

- **Don't manually edit `convex/_generated/`** — the Convex CLI overwrites these files. The committed versions are stubs that survive between dev runs; further hand-edits will be lost on the next `convex dev`/`deploy`.
- **Don't add an `api/webhooks/clerk` route in Next.js.** The webhook lives in Convex's HTTP router (`convex/http.ts`) so secrets stay server-side and we avoid a hop.
- **Don't make `users.upsertFromClerk` a public mutation.** Anyone could spoof identities.
- **Don't gitignore `.env.example`** — it's the template.
- **Don't introduce a new state library** (Redux, Zustand, etc.) for data that should live in Convex. Local UI state via `useState` is fine; persistent state should round-trip through Convex.
- **Don't bypass `_authz.ts` helpers.** Every query/mutation that reads or writes a folder/list/task must resolve up the hierarchy with `requireListAccess`/`requireSpaceAccess`/`requireFolderAccess`.

## Phased roadmap

We are building this out in numbered phases, one PR each. See PR descriptions for what shipped in each.

- **Phase 0 (PR #1):** Scaffold + marketing/auth/onboarding/dashboard shell + PWA.
- **Phase 1:** Hierarchy + tasks v1 — Spaces/Folders/Lists/Tasks, sidebar tree, list view with task CRUD, real Convex queries replacing mock data, onboarding wired.
- **Phase 2:** Custom fields + per-list custom statuses, list settings page.
- **Phase 3:** Views — List/Board/Calendar/Gantt selectable via tabs (`?view=` query param). Board uses @dnd-kit; Calendar and Gantt are hand-rolled with date-fns.
- **Phase 4:** Threaded task comments + workspace chat, @mentions with inline picker, assigned comments, /dashboard/inbox with unread badge in the sidebar. Realtime is automatic via Convex `useQuery` subscriptions.
- **Phase 5:** Rich-text docs (Tiptap, debounced save) and tldraw whiteboards (dynamic-imported, debounced save). Both attach to user/workspace/space and appear in the sidebar tree alongside lists.
- **Phase 6:** Time tracking with a live timer (sidebar chip + per-task tracker, only one running per user), Goals (number/money/boolean) on workspaces, and a Reports tab per workspace with fixed widgets (open tasks, completed-this-week, time-tracked-this-week, goal progress, workload by assignee).
- **Phase 7:** Recurring tasks (daily/weekly/monthly, regenerated on completion) and a minimal list-automation engine (trigger + action rules evaluated inside `tasks.create` / `tasks.update`).
- **Phase 8 (current):** Outbound email notifications via Resend (mentions and task assignments, scheduled via `ctx.scheduler.runAfter` so they don't block the originating mutation) and Clips (browser screen+mic recording uploaded to Convex file storage, played back in the task detail).
- **Phase 9:** AI (Brain) — knowledge search, task auto-fill, summaries, writer.
- **Phase 10:** Templates + 3rd-party integrations + Teams Hub.
- **Phase 11:** Offline-first PWA polish + native app wrappers.

## Known limitations (not bugs)

- The committed `convex/_generated/` is a hand-rolled stub. Until you run `npx convex dev`, `useQuery`/`useMutation` calls return without strict argument checking on individual functions. Once the CLI overwrites it, full type safety kicks in.
- Resend has no email flows wired — the wrapper exists but no template/sender code is built.
- PWA icons are SVG-only; some Android variants prefer PNGs.
- Status column reorder is wired in Convex (`listStatuses.reorder`) but no drag-and-drop UI yet for status columns themselves; tasks within columns ARE draggable via Board view.
- No saved-view configs yet (filter/sort/group selections don't persist). View choice is in the URL via `?view=`, but other settings reset on reload.
- Calendar and Gantt are read-only — no drag-to-reschedule. Edit a task's date from the task detail page or List view.
- Inbox doesn't yet deep-link from a task mention back to its list page (would require a task → list resolver query). Workspace chat mentions deep-link correctly.
- Mentions don't trigger email yet — Resend is wired but no notification flow has been built.
- Docs and whiteboards save with last-write-wins (debounced). No CRDT collab yet; concurrent editors can clobber each other's changes.
- tldraw is loaded with `next/dynamic` (`ssr: false`) so it only ships on the whiteboard route. Its license requires keeping the watermark unless you have a commercial license — we currently keep the default watermark.
- The Reports query (`reports.workspaceSummary`) walks the workspace tree (spaces → folders → lists → tasks) and joins time entries per task. It's O(tasks + entries) and fine at the sizes we target; needs cursors/pagination once any workspace grows beyond a few thousand tasks.
- Goals don't auto-update from tasks yet — progress is logged manually. Auto-rollup ("complete X tasks in list Y") is a follow-up.
- Reports widget layout is fixed; users can't add/remove/rearrange widgets yet.
- Automations are evaluated event-driven only — no scheduled (time-based) triggers like "every Monday at 9am" yet. Use Convex crons for that when needed.
- Automation actions are primitives that call `db.patch` directly. They don't re-enter `tasks.update`, so a `set_status` action that points at a complete-category status won't re-fire `status_changed_to_complete` automations or recurrence in the same call.
- The `assign_user` automation accepts a Clerk user ID; the list-settings UI uses a free-text input rather than a member picker. Add member-aware UI alongside Phase 10 (Teams Hub).
- Email send actions (`notifications.ts`) read `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` at invocation time. Without those env vars set on the Convex deployment, the action logs and no-ops — no mutation rollback. Inbound email (turning replies into comments) is not built yet.
- Clips use the browser's `getDisplayMedia` + `MediaRecorder`. Browser support varies: Safari handles screen capture but not always with mic; Firefox/Chrome/Edge are fine. The recorder picks the first supported `mimeType` from a small candidate list (vp9 → vp8 → webm → mp4).
